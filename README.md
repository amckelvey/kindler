# Kindler - Commit to your right developer


### Project Description


Kindler is a streamlined way for software developers and recruiters to match with each other. The app presents a recruiter with an easy to navigate interface where they can see prospective developers and a quick snapshot of their skills and projects. If a recruiter decides a developer is a good match, they can contact the potential hire and quickly find a role for them.
